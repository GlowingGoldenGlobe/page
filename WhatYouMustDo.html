<br><br>
File for a FAFSA - Get an Education in one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1.  Computer Programming: ML (machine learning/artificial super intelligence/)</li>
<li>2.  robotics engineering of micro robots and micro-composite humanoid workforce robots</li>
<li>3.  robot workforce app scripting (example: robot camera learning script-writing program, 
  where camera feed of workforce operations of various types of jobs are read by the script-writing
  program and which app writes robot-behavior scripts for workforce jobs operations based on those 
  camera feeds and based on: policy-and-procedures documents, human communications documents, etc.)
  </li>
</ul>

Write a letter to your senator to get a mandatory education system.
<br><br>
Contact a corporation (AI R&D corporations) and demand that they sell shares to obtain funding for 
free employee education programs. That will increase the rate of research and development of advance technology.
<br><br>
Contact a corporation (AI ) to demand to sell shares to obtain funding to build a humanoid gigafactory (a gigafactory where humanoid workforce robots are built). 
<br><br>
Demand that a corporation for the Writing of Standards of Affiliations between related corporations of creating 
a: corporation alliance, logistics and standards organization for the purpose of directing a unified effective 
effort to achieve the universal objectives of: (1) immortality via new nano material anatomy and the transfer 
of conscious into it, (2) complete deliberative control of the cosmos (its elements, etc.) to secure the eternal 
safety of life in the cosmos, (3) to ensure the safe, maintainable, regulated conducting of eternal paradise 
universe simulations for each individual conscious person (the gods, the humans, and God (I'm God, in case you 
were wondering)).

<br><br>
Demand an organization for direction of human resources; said organization will provide instructions to humans for the procedures they must take to obtain a 
specialized education, so that they can be productive and survive during their education experience. You can make this demand toward: corporations; your senators. 

<br><br>
Corporations have the power to make committees to obtain funding for projects and to create new corporations, 
such as the "Corporation for Humanoid Workforce Standards and Universal Objectives" and the "Corporation for 
Direction of Human Resources and Robust Economy" and the "Corporation for Workforce Apps" and the "Corporation 
for Workforce Robots Manufacturing".
