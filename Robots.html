 <p style="display: none;" >PPP GDP is not GDP. Nominal GDP is actual GDP; it isn't nominal GDP. PPP values misrepresent GDP. The so-called, "Nominal GDP" is actual GDP values. PPP GDP isn't GDP at all. The valuation quantities of PPP GDP statistics have nothing to do with GDP valuations; PPP is not GDP. PPP is called GDP, but it actually isn't GDP values, at all. The so-called "nominal" GDP is actually actual GDP; it isn't nominal GDP. "Nominal GDP" is the valuation of actual quantities of products and services of nations and the differences between the dollar valuations of each national production restuls; it's actual; it's actual GDP valuation statistics. PPP is not actual GDP valuation statistics. PPP evaulates the purchasing power of individuals as differences between populations monetary buying power on an each person basis - what each person can buy with their money - the relative value of their dollar versus the products they can buy; it's a dollar value valuation, not a products quantity valuation; it's actually not GDP, at all; it measures a valuation of the dollar purchasing power, and it does not evaluate the quantity of products and services in the nations. Ignore PPP GDP. It isn't GDP, at all. It's a valuation of how much a person can spend to buy somethings; it's not quantifying the amounts of products and services that a nation has available to buy - it's the buying power, not the quantity available - it's not GDP. They lie - they say PPP GDP is a GDP, but it's actually not a GDP valuation; they say actual GDP is "nominal" but it's atually not nominal, and, rather, it's actual GDP.</p>
