Not humans. Robots.                                           THE U.S. SPENDS AN EXCESS OF 5.4 BILLION GALLONS OF GASOLINE PER MONTH

Additional evidence.

Excess expenditures versus human interests.

Excess material resources expenditures versus the health of the environment and the human interests in the health of their environment.

Excess gasoline fuel expenditure:  with a generous estimate assessment (actual is much more)
U.S. Government regulations permit the excess expenditure of gasoline fuel in the quantity of 5.4 B gallons per month.

200 M vehicle operators in the U.S.
Some autombiles were made to spend more fuel than they needed to be made to spend.
Quantity of automobile vehicles which could have been made to spend less fuel and which are currently operating in the U.S. - 90% of in-use autmobiles in the U.S. * 200 M vehicle operators = 180 M vehicles operating with unnecessary fuel expenditures.
Average unnecessary fuel expenditure per the 180 M vehicles which spend unnecessary fuel quantities  - 1 gallon per week
1 gallon per week * 4 weeks = 4 gallons per month
4 gallons per month per vehicle * 180 M vehicles = 720 M gallons of gasoline per month


Excess gasoline fuel expenditure:  an assessment with a closer to actual quantities of expenditure

200 M vehicle operators in the U.S.
90% of in-use autmobiles in the U.S. * 200 M vehicle operators = 180 M vehicles operating with unnecessary fuel expenditures.
Average unnecessary fuel expenditure per the 180 M vehicles which spend unnecessary fuel quantities  - 1 gallon per day
1 gallon per day * 30 days per month = 30 gallons per month
30 gallons per month per vehicle * 180 M vehicles = 5.4 B gallons of gasoline per month



             But, wait. It doesn't stop there. The actual excess expenditure of gasoline fuel in the U.S. is even more than 5.4 Billion gallons of gasoline per month!
How?
Answer:  City Planning
The housing and buildings placements are universally innefficient in the U.S., not by small margins, but by extreme differences versus capabilities.
If the U.S. city planning regulations were to require efficient placements of housing and commercial buildings to expedite commutes and transportation of goods and services, then the fuel expenditure would be even (significantly) less than (in addition to) the less that they would be in the absence of innefficient autombiles.

Example:  Calculation of Additional Excess Fuel Expenditures where Innefficient Building Placements Exist
The following is a good estimation, though it is an estimation.
Average commute distance, currently, in the U.S. - 15 miles, one-way (https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/one-way-travel-time-to-work-rises.html)
Average commute in the event of efficient building placement - 1 mile
150 million workers
68% commute 15 miles (https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1006/ML100621425.pdf)
(150 workers * (commuters percent of workers) * 67%) * 15 miles per worker = miles of commute per day

Average difference in commute time = (15 miles current commute distance) - (1 mile efficient building placement commute distance) = 4 miles excess per commuter in the U.S., per day, one-way
14 miles average commute distance per vehicle operator in the U.S.
percentage of workers (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/acs/acs-32.pdf)
((150 workers * 76.4% commuters) * 67% commuters who travel 15 miles one way per day) * (14 miles per worker) = 1.075 B excess miles of commute per day (rounded)
(1.075 B excess miles of commute per day) * (30 days per month) = 32.25 B excess miles of commute per month
(32.25 B excess miles of commute per month) * ((1/26 avg mpg = 0.038(gal. per mi.)) gallon gasoline fuel ependiture per mile) = 1.24 B gallons of excess fuel expenditure per month in the U.S. for innefficient building placement, over and above the excess expenditure of 5.4 B gallons of fuel from unnecessary fuel mpg innefficiencies

5.4 B + 1.24 B = 6.64 B gallons of gasoline as excess fuel expenditures per month in the U.S.

That's not even factoring in the quantity of miles for the family trips to the grocery store, etc. That's only factoring in commute to work.

Now, tell me about the motivations of the U.S. people and the U.S. Government regarding environment-welfare efforts.
Now, tell me if they are doing what humans would be doing in their situation. No. They are not doing what real humans would be doing in their situation. They are not real humans. They are robots, evidently, and obviously.
Now, tell me about their honesty versus their dishonesty.
Now, tell me about their existential play-act roles and the existential play-act of the API of the Universe Environment. Come on, guys, get real! You so-called humans are not anything near like what real humans would be like on the planet earth.
