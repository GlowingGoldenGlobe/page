<h3>Section 1: &nbsp;Software Edu Must Be Required for All US Citizens</h3>
<textarea id="id_t_1" class="class_t_1" >
Among all degree options, I only need to become a software engineer (more specifically - (1) a Machine-Learning-Engineer, and (2) an Artificial-Intelligence-Engineer); and the reason is because a software engineer can write a program which makes itself acquire the credentials of ability and knowledge of any other needed career (discipline; field of study; degree; certification; doctorate degree).




Description 1
A software engineer can build an AI which can learn and do any and every other thing (field of study and results of it); so, obviously, become a software engineer!!




Description 2
A software engineering degree has to be (must be) a required education for all able-bodied humans. The reason is because software engineering is a fundamental method for utilization of data (data about every field of study) by which any desired result of any field of study can be feasibly obtained by the user (the software engineer).




Description 3
An AI can build an brain API about Electric Engineering  -  An AGI can make itself an electrical engineer.

Therefore, all you have to do is become a:  (1) software engineer.

An AI can become a: (2) robotics engineer.

That means, you don't have to have a robotics engineering degree; and, you don't have to obtain an electrical engineering degree.




Description 4
Why this is absolutely true.
An AI can build based on probability - what is the probability that I (the user) would build a humanoid like this? The AI can determine, based on probability, what type of robot the user would build. Therefore, the user doesn't need a degree in robotics in order to build a robot, the user merely needs a degree in software engineering to build an API which can calculate the probability of user desired product design results.

Additionaly, I already know what type of robot (or robots, in this case) to build, anyway - micro-robot-composite superintelligence humanoid workforce population consisting of many (hundreds of millions) humanoids - from this data, the AI can calculate the probability of the desired robot result product that I (the user) wants, and it can build the robots based on the probability it concludes on, with user (my) approval, upon providing me with query-result-options.



Description 5
What students need:
(1)  a general description (generality regarding details of descriptions) of each and every subject (field of study; career path study program) which can be learned via a college education or via a certification;
(2)  a software engineering degree; to build an AI which can learn robotics engineering and any other field of study needed to produce the wanted results of any field of study.

Example
If you want a doctor at a hospital, then, do as follows:
Query your AI for, "Build a Hospital Doctor".
Then, your AI will, in a very short time versus the human ability, learn medical school education data; simulate 3-D humanoid behavior based on doctor behavior and probability versus its acquired medical training; build an AI API for "Hospital Doctor"; download the "Hospital Doctor"-AI-API to a humanoid robot; send the new doctor-robot to the hospital, and send the earnings of the doctor-robot to me (the user or other the software engineer that built the robot via the software engineer's AI query).

<h3>Section 2: &nbsp;Curriculum - What it isn't; and what it's supposed to be</h3>
<textarea id="id_t_2" class="class_t_1" >
It goes something like this:

3-D Physics Simulation Software (*1, below)
AI 3-D Simulation on user query (*2, below)
AI 3-D Extrapolation of AI 3-D Simulation of user query (*3, below)
AI options results menu (*4, below)
user selection among AI options results menu (*5, below)
user query to modify user selection opted (*6 below)
AI 3-D Extrapolation Simulation of user query to modify user selection opted (*7 below)
AI 2nd options results menu (*8 below)
user selection among AI 2nd options results menu (*9 below)
Done! (*10 below)



Explanation 1
Obviously, the programs and education programs and courses online should provide a curriculum catering to the needs which satisfy the result shown above.

Explanation 2
It is obvious that the description of AI Engineering, shown above, is the most productive method in the 21st century.

Explanation 3
Unfortunately, the morons concacting the curriculum of the degrees and online courses regarding software engineering have not, yet, to date, provided a set of courses which satisfies the requirements of the best method, shown above.




*Descriptions*


*1.  
(3-D physics engine to simulate real-world object motions, sounds, and interactions (collisions, changes (water to ice, for example), and modifications (solutions to mixtures, for example))


*2.
1.  User enters a query to the ~AI 3-D Simulation Software Program~ to create an object or scene (a set of objects and commands regarding events (motions, modifications, and sounds)
2.  The AI obtains data from databases and online sources to relay results and/or build data results
3.  The AI simulates 3-D movies with the data it obtained


*3.
1.  The AI makes predictions about the simulation to synthesize probable simulation activities
2.  The AI extrapolates the simulation data based on the predictions it made
3.  The AI simulates many (a few, tens, hundreds, thousands, or etc.) of instances of 3-D simulation videos, and stores them (saves the simulation data)


*4.
1.  The most likely resulting top 10 simulations are selected by the AI;
2.  The AI displays a menu of the options - 10 buttons about the simulations (one button display for each 3-D movie simulation), for the user to review and opt from;


*5.
1.  The user reviews the descriptions of the simulations;
2.  The user reviews the most likely simulation video(s) (discovered when reviewing the descriptions)
3.  The user chooses an option among the menu options, and selects it (clicks), indicating to the AI that the user opts the selection


*6.
1.  Upon user-indication of selecting an option from the AI provided result menu, the AI provides an option menu to the user to query for further modification (edits) to the simulation;
2.  The user describes any modifications wanted by the user


*7.
1.  The AI further extrapolates simulations to modify (edit) the user-selected option


*8.
1.  The AI displays a 2nd results menu (this menu displays results created in response to the user's requested modifications to the user's selected option from the 1st results menu)


*9.
1.  The user reviews the 2nd results menu descriptions
2.  The user reviews a likely simulation among the 2nd results menu options
3.  The user selects a likely simulation option from the 2nd results menu


*10.
1.  If the user is satisfied with the result, the procedure is finished ("Done!"); else,
2.  The user might indicate to the AI another (an additional, another query to obtain a 3rd results menu options-set) description query requiring further modifications (edits) to the selected result menu option, or the user might make a new query with a different query description to obtain different results.
