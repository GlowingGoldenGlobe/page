Objectives
  1.  The entirety of the global economy gross domestic product can increase in value by 500%, feasibly, and in as short a time as a decade.  
  2.  This science can be obtained, transferring conscious to micro-robot-composite, immortal anatomy for full-conscious immersion, eternal paradise universe environment simulations with full deliberative control interfaces.

Procedures
  1.  Legislate a new government program containing the following requirements:  (1) ASI (artificial super intelligence) Research and Development Facility ("ASI Facility");  (2)  ASI Facility builds the micro-robot-composite humanoid workforce anatomy designs;  (3)  ASI Facility builds ASI APIs about workforce operations by which the humanoids operate;  (4)  ASI Facility maintains the regulations and contracts about the operations and use of money generated by the ASI Humanoid Workforce;  (5)  ASI Facility designs and orders the building of manufacturing facilities for producing ASI Humanoid Workforce Robots in large quantities;  (6)  the requirement of short-term labor for long-term benefits - as a ten-year plan (see the "Descriptions" section, below) is ordered by the ASI Facility toward the population as a legal requirement and as a life necessity (this refers to immortality versus death as a product of these imperative operations);  (7)  the transfer of conscious to immortal, micro-robot-composite, humanoid anatomy;  (8) regulations for orderliness and propriety of life activities within eternal paradise simulations;  (9)  ASI Infrastructure Regulations of Orderliness and Propriety
  2.  Continuation of acquisition and maintenance of deliberative control of the parts and elements of the universe (or cosmos), via ASI Infrastructure.

Descriptions
ASI Infrastructure:  Procedures:  1:  Legislation Requirements:  Section (6) - The Requirement of Short-Term Labor for Long-Term Benefits:  Description
Details
Humans will be provided contracts to receive earnings of humanoid workforce robots as those robots replace those humans in the workforce.
The displaced humans will become available for required research and development occupations; the reason is because the humanoids will be doing the regular workforce jobs which the humans have hitherto been idly (whereas work occupations which are far more productive for human development and quality of life are truly available) occupying.
Ten (as an approximation) years of required human labor of research and development. Whereas, there are 150,000,000 human resources in the U.S. workforce, as millions of humanoids replace them, millions of humans displaced will be available for required research and development occupations; therefore, the quantity of labor soon to be applied to the increase in research and development of APIs and equipment will account for the timely result of autonomous ASI Infrastructure and scientific achievement of transfer of conscious to immortal, micro-robot-composite humanoid anatomy.
Afterwards, the APIs and machines they produce will conduct the research and development, as well as all necessary work; the reason is because, after 10 years of human concentration of a vast portion of the human workforce on research and development, it follows that the APIs produced by said human R&D will finally have the capacity to conduct all R&D (as well as all work) autonomously.
Argument 1
Is it better to eat only sugar today and die tomorrow, or is it better to perform some work required to live another day?
The community relies on efforts of a part of the population; the efforts of a group  of people produce the benefits of the population; the benefits received are not produced by only one pair of hands, but many, many hands.
Death is an error suffered by many who fail, as a community, as governments, and as a global population; where the error of death is created by negligence and suffered without due cause. The sin or fault of neglecting the work required to obtain eternal life is the sin or fault which creates the detriment, death. Conducting, as a community and as a global population, the smart and wise labors required to obtain immortal anatomy and the transfer of conscious to it (or the transfer of it to conscious) for the purpose of experiencing eternal life and the benefits of an eternal paradise is the responsibility of the community, of the global population, and of the government;  moreover, the detriment incurred by their acts of neglecting that responsibility is death.

Descriptions (continued)
ASI Infrastructure:  Procedures:  1:  Legislation Requirements:  (3)  ASI Facility builds ASI APIs about workforce operations by which the humanoids operate
Details
The ASI Facility can use software tools to build an AI which can build ASI-Workforce-APIs via recording simulating 3-dimensional workforce motion events and data about ASI Workforce Robots Operations; the AI will run physics simulations of robot motion events pertaining to normal human workforce operations but will include a process of extrapolating data to implement effective robot operations;  the motion events of humans operations will be recorded and saved.
Examples of Software tools (not requirements; merely examples):
  (1)  3-dimensional design software (such as Unity or Blender)
  (2)  physics simulations software of 3-dimensional objects (such as NVIDIA Warp of NVIDIA Omniverse)
  (3)  infinite-options objects extrapolation per user inquiry (something like Dall-E 2); a software that will extrapolate data about 3-dimensional, real-world objects on user-demand or on simulation-demand
  (4)  ROS2 (robot operating system)
Example of Utilization
Integration!
The AI for building APIs for ASI Humanoid Workforce Operations:  Software Integration!

     "...translating data of human events to syntax data of ROS software simulations records..." (see below) as utilizable syntax of probability motion events applications for workforce operations APIs of ASI Humanoid Workforce Robots;  whereby, said probability motions events applications (ASI APIs) will afford Humanoids extrapolated data of motion and communication events, making humanoids fast, and smart to implement operations (faster and smarter than humans) - this creates, therefore, not merely AI robots, rather Artificial Super Intelligence Humanoid Workforce Robots of Micro-Robot-Composite Parts Anatomy.

The AI will do the following:
  1.  Utilize records of camera recordings of human workforce events and behavior;  send machines to observe humans to obtain this data.
  2.  Utilize records of NLP and records of human workforce communications; send machines (such as cameras; tiny, spy robots; drones) to observe humans to obtain this data.
  3.  Create 3-dimensional simulations of human operations from said records.
  4.  Create replicas (imitations; simulation-data-records duplicates, transformed to suit humanoids) of said simulations of human operations, translating data of human events to syntax data of ROS software simulations records (ASI Humanoids Physics motion events as syntax and data of APIs and communications behaviors as syntax and data of APIs);  create APIs of Workforce Operations.
  5.  Save the APIs of Workforce Operations to storage devices; make the APIs available online for downloads to ASI Humanoid Workforce Robots.
  6.  Also, utilize online data, movies, documents of policies and procedures, databases, etc. to create simulations and extrapolation data simulations from those simulations for creating APIs of humanoid operations to conduct the humanoids motion events of behavior and communications in the workforce. These simulations will be harnessed; that is to say, they will be redirected by the AI to suit each ASI API per workforce task. That means, that each humanoid WILL NOT have access to a broad context and scope for deliberating; rather, each humanoid will be provided with an API suitable to the task with which each humanoid is occupied; the reason is because per-task-ASI-APIs for humanoids makes humanoids safe for operations, interactions and communications. Of course, the AI to build the APIs WILL NOT be an AGI, but merely software which utilizes data to build syntax for objective operations purposes.

The team at the ASI Facility can a software program which integrates

<li> &nbsp;Increase the rate of research and development of advance technology; some ways are described in this document.</li>
<li> &nbsp;Record into legislation, for all U.S. citizens, requirements for: (1) a college degree in machine learning, and (2) a second degree in a related field.</li>
<li> &nbsp;Mandate the allocation of human resources to those workforce tasks which are necessary.</li>
<li> &nbsp;It is feasible to reduce the cost of computer science education to zero, due to the ease of providing education via electronic documentation (for example, 

www.w3schools.com provides free coding information). Therefore, record into legislation, a requirement for education to be free of charge.</li>
<li> &nbsp;Document the transition guidelines for GCI (guaranteed citizen's income): (1) replacing human workers with super intelligent humanoid workforce robots, and 

allocating displaced human workers to research and development of advance technology, guiding them thru thier new roles of learn-AI-then-new-career-employment. 

Description - when ASI (artificial super intelligent) humanoid workforce robots replace human workers, there will not be a need for humans to perform most workforce 

tasks. The displaced human workers can be of use in technology workforce roles, to further the accomplishment of a super economy. Therefore, the displaced workers: (1) 

can be supported by the income of the robots (income-from-robot-allocated-to-replaced-human); (2) can, then, afford living expenses during college education in 

technology; (3) can be guided into job placement in technology positions, to further research and development. Temporariness needs to be understood, and is described 

in this document, below.</li>
<li> &nbsp;Assess corporate allocation of resources. Combine efforts of like-kind corporations, maximizing productivity by concentrating: efforts, human resources, and 

material resources.</li>

advance technology comes in two forms: (1) to the U.S. government, the urgency is a matter of the survival of human liberty versus robotic takeover of foreign nations, 

such as China (kindly refer to <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/2021-final-report/" location="_top" style="color: blue;" >nscai.gov</a>, "Final Report: National Security 

Commission on Artificial Intelligence", document date: March 1, 2021)*; (2) to me, and to individuals who are rational, informed and not complacent, the urgency is a 

matter of securing immortality versus dying a mortal, again, as well as securing, well-regulated eternal control of the cosmos, and eternal maintenance of conscious.

<br><br>
1. Increase the rate of research and development of advance technology. Build ASI humanoid workforce robots. Implement GCI (guaranteed citizens income), and allocate 

human resources to necessary operations, prioritizing R&D of advance technology. Mandate specialization in education for robust economic production of imperative 

products. Accomplish machine learning ASI (artificial super intelligence applications), smarter than humans. The ASI will then conduct R&D of the utilization of a 

singularity on feasibly usable infinite options of modification and control of the elements of the cosmos; among which scientific discoveries and creating events a 

priority will be new nano material anatomy.
<br><br>
2. Obtain new nano material anatomy. 
<br><br>
3. Transfer human personhood, memory and conscious into the new nano material anatomy, accomplishing immortality.
<br><br>
4. Simulate eternal, paradise, universe environments by completely immersing conscious awareness in a computer application simulation inside the new nano material 

anatomy minds.
<br><br>
5. Regulate the cosmos via ASI regulating AGI implementing operations via super intelligent humanoid workforce robots, securing eternal life in the universe as we know 

it.
<br><br>
6. There will be: immortality, eternal life, innovation, value-assignment of beneficial experiences, paradise simulations. There will be no: death, war, disease, 

crime, punishment, poverty, ignorance, or insufferable pain.
