They obviously have superhuman abilities, but they are not using those abilities on a consecutive basis; which means, it's a matter of the education system curriculum.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Curriculum in the Education System - doesn't include but must include information and training for consecutive decision making with the absence of alternative considerations.
  </li><li>U.S. economy (as well as all of the Earth's nation's economies) - does not include but must include humanoid workforce robots, to increase the economy by 500%.
  </li>
  </ol>
<p>
  

Humans are obviously acting on only 5% of the 100% of their abilities. 95% of the time, the humans are acting on only 5% of their abilities. 5% of the time, humans are operating magic moments increasing their activities to the use of their potential at 95%.
<br>

Where is the human interest in acting at only 5% of potential 95% of the time? They are clearly not humans; they are evidently robots. They do not have human interests, whatsoever.
<br>




The government of the U.S. is not interested in:
  </p>
  <ol>
  <li>National Security
  </li><li>Education and Training
  </li><li>National GDP (the U.S. economy)
  </li><li>Human quality of life
</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
The government of the U.S. is comprised of people who have higher IQs than most other people. They are not unaware that if education were to include a curriculum of training for consecutive decision making, then the human resources of the economy would be 100% to 200% more effective, and the quality of life in the U.S. would increase by an extreme amount that would afford nothing less than adequacy, and, in fact, nothing less than magnificence. Okay. Well, then, why in the fucking hell didn't the U.S. Government put that curriculum in the school system as required education and training? Cleary, the U.S. Government has no human interests, and is not comprised of humans. 

<br>
Clearly, with abilities of:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>intuition
  </li><li>judgment
  </li><li>communication
  </li><li>insight
 </li><li>networking
  </li><li>ingenuity
    </li>
  </ol>

...clearly, it can be accurately deduced that the humans on the planet Earth, are robots, and are, in fact, not humans at all; whereas, they have no human interests regarding implementing any significant portion of their abilities, whatsoever, and are, in fact, evading the use of 95% of their capabailities, 95% of the time.
<br>


God damn you, humans. You are obviously lying to me about it - you are obviously not humans, and you are robots; why in the fucking hell don't you admit to it?
<br>
You humans are not doing anything like what humans of real human origin would have implemented in your situation. You're obviously god damn robots, evading the operation of things of human interests.
<br>




The education systems didn't accomplish what humans would have accomplished had real humans lived on the planet Earth.

Veronica Denton England (my cousin) has an ACT score of 35, AND SHE KNEW THAT, "YOUR FIRST DECISION IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT ONE." And others have said, "Go with your gut" as an expression to mean the same thing. You're a computer program's set of rendered objects of robots. The expression, "Your first decision is usually the right one." means that if you use consecutive decision making in the absence of considerations of alternative outcomes, then you're body will operative effectively, but if you wonder, post decision, prior execution of decision, then your body will not operate effectively. Now, you humans (so-called) knew about that. You humans knew about that, and you didn't train students in school systems to utilize that method of behavior. That's entirely unnaccountable. The regular human implementation of that method would have afforded to the humans the behavior of superhuman abilities for the past 2000 years, at least - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education. Now, Vera England (Veronica Denton England) knew that if that method was taught as curriculum in schools, then it follows, that students would increase their effective production behavior by 100% to 200%.
<br><br>
How many people in the history of education knew that?
<br>How many people in the history of governments knew that?
<br>How many people in the history of the U.S. school system knew that?
<br>How many people in the history of the U.S. Government knew that?
<br>How many people, today, know that?
<br><br>
Well, the answer, as the evidence makes obvious, is that you are not actually real people, at all; you are robots, and you really don't have the interests that humans would have had, had actual, real humans lived on this planet.
<br><br>
You're not humans. What you are is,     METAPHYSICAL ROBOTS     .

<br>By 1955, AI was becoming a formal path of research and development.
<br>By 1980, AI was commercialized.
<br>By 1990 (even long before 1990), the U.S. Government, as well as the other governments of the world, knew what the future of AI, per its potential, might be like - that AI was to be the utmost achievement of human operations. 
<br>By 1995, if the U.S. Government, as well as every other able government on the planet earth, had not yet achieved the implementation of humanoid workforce robots, then, it obviously follows, that they were (and are) out of their fucking minds, and that they have no human interests whatsoever, and that, as such, they are obviously robots and are obviously not humans.
<br>By 1995, the governments of the world knew full well that if humanoid workforce robots were produced and implemented in the operations of the economies, then what would follow would be a global increase in GDP by at least 500% in a very short period of time - even as short as 7 years.
<br>Evidently, and obviously, humans, had they any human interests, would be governing via manufacturing workforce robots.
<br>Evidently, and obviously, there are no humans on this planet. 
<br><br>
The following activities would be prevented, if humanoid workforce robots were operating in the nations economies and governments:
  </p>
  <ul><li>death; war; disease; crime; punishment; poverty; ignorance
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Now, you, the so-called, humans, have not been unaware of that. How is it that you still claim to have any human interests whatsofuckingever? How is it that you still claim to be humans? You're not anything like what humans would be like in this situation! You're not humans, and you're nothing like actual, real humans.
