Learning Guide

Artificial Intelligence

Purpose
1.  Build super-intelligence humanoid workforce robots;
2.  Increase the earth's economy by 500%;
3.  Obtain the transfer of conscious to new immortal anatomy, and eternal-paradise, full-conscious-immersion simulations (immortality in paradise).

w3schools.com (learning at w3schools.com was free, the last time I used it; optionally, you can purchase a certificate for a small fee)

Programming Languages to Learn
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Python
AI (artificial intelligence)
Machine Learning
C++
ROS (robot-operating-system)
robotics
physics simulation software

AI-3D-Infinity-Simulation-Builder-API
  -->  translation of movie 3D simulations to ROS syntax for super-intelligence-humanoid-workforce (humanoid-body-motions) APIs.
  -->  this simulation-software may not exist, yet; however, you can build it (after the reader has learned the above-mentioned programming languages, these following (unaffiliated, like w3schools) websites might be helpful for building the AI-3D-Infinity-Simulation-Builder-API:  infinity.ai;  blender.org)
  
3D-Printer
3D-Printer Software

Study Plan
3 to 5 years
  part-time work
  full-time study
Afterward-Study Plan
  3D-Printer:  print a personal workforce humanoid (10-times-smarter than a human; 10-times-faster than a human)
  (in addition to government; only if government does not legislate in a timely manner)
  small-business:  manufacture robots
  corporation:  manufacture super-intelligence humanoids
Benefit
  A workforce-humanoid will make you $100K per year, while you conduct research and development.
  Whereas, if all 150,000,000 human resources currently employed in the US do the same, said thing, then, if follows, the rate of research and development will increase exponentially, affording the timely acquisition of: (1) new, immortal anatomy, and (2) the transfer of conscious to it, for immortality and full-conscious-immersion-simulations-of-eternal-paradise-with-full-deliberative-control-interfaces.

Additional Information:  Part 1
AI
ML
ASI
AGI

AI:  artificial intelligence
ML:  Machine Learning
ASI:  artificial superintelligence
AGI:  artificial general intelligence

AGI - you don't need AGI (until you are ready to takeover and run the entire world; however, hopefully your are ready to do that).
You need all of the other ones, as follows:  AI, ML, ASI.

Additional Information:  Part 2
Extrapolation Data
Simulations need to extrapolate data based on: (1) user-needs (abilities to obtain and use material resources), (2) user-wants (immortality, infrastructure, city-planning and building, life-style, right-judgment regulations (law-enforcement), and ideology regulations (propriety, sensibility, and orderliness)), and (3) probabilities (e.g., probable motions, trajectories)
Regarding the to-be-found or to-be-built, above-mentioned, AI-3D-Infinity-Simulation-Builder-API - The extrapolation of data, aforementioned, is a method for using information to build simulations of motion behavior based on plans for objective-achievement, like so:
The AI-3D-Infinity-Simulation-Builder-API will:
  assess the user objective to comprehend it
  gather information related to achieving the objective
  simulate robot motion-behavior related to performing the necessary tasks
  store said simulations, which the aforementioned AI software builds, to a storage location (such as: a computer-hard-drive, usb or cloud server)
  
  
Additional Information:  Part 3
Information Obtainment
Internet Search Data
Policies and Procedures:  all businesses
Online Books (e.g., educational textbooks: mathematics; physics; molecular science (material resources pyhsics and usages))
Drone-transported-robots-and-cameras:  movie-capturing about human motion behavior regarding workplace activities, methods, and organization
  -->  AI software can automatically assess movie data, categorize it, and, from it, create robot-body-motion-simulation movies and ROS APIs by which humanoid-workforce-robots can conduct their activities and operations to achieve objectives.
